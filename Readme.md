# ALINQ - Asynchronous LINQ to Objects query processing

Currently we are at a very limited alpha release state, a lot of things are still
being worked on and in flux, and quite a few operators are not implemented yet.

Missing LINQ operators:

 - GroupBy
 - GroupJoin
 - ThenBy
 - ThenByDescending
 - ToLookup
