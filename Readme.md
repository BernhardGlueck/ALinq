# ALINQ - Asynchronous LINQ to Objects query processing

Currently we are at a very limited alpha release state, a lot of things are still
being worked on and in flux.
By now most standard LINQ operators are implemented, but test coverage is still low, and is the next
focus in development. 

A few operators are still missing as listed below:

 - ThenBy
 - ThenByDescending
 - ToLookup
