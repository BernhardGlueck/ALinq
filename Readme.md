# ALINQ - Asynchronous LINQ to Objects query processing

Currently we are at a very limited alpha release state, a lot of things are still

By now most standard LINQ operators are implemented, but test coverage is still low, and is the next
focus in development. 

Missing linq operators:
 - ToLookup ... for now won't implement until there is a specific request for it.
